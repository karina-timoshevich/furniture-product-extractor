Brand:ikonitaly Brand: Voices of Design Lovers We are as happy as can be with our two new Altek baba dining chairs. After finding two in oak at a vintage fair I searched far and wide to find more of these very comfortable and sleek chairs. The price was reasonable and we love them in walnut. JMC Luke and his team went above and beyond ensuring my client's product was safely and swiftly replaced when the first delivery underwent a huge mishap -- the leather of the laundry basket, the craftsmanship, the weight -- all surpassed expectations. We will definitely be continuing doing our business with ikonitaly and using our pieces to elevate the homes of our clients. Emily I purchased two sets of single, double seat and a table. They look amazing, very well made and sturdy. Came very securely packaged. The best testimony for this furniture is that, as soon as it arrived, I purchased another set! Fantastic. Thank you x Magdalena Designed to be different. Table top Art work. Ceramic pottery with a twist. Cathal Considering the price and the design, I was expecting a higher quality in the material. Denise It was my first time ordering from ikonitaly; I was impressed by the selection of designer furniture and accessories available. Customer service was very efficient and arranged fast delivery to Malta. Very happy with our carpet choice, thanks! Andrew Join ikonitaly!
