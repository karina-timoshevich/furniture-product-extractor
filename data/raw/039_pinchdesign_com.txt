49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Black American walnut Black American walnut Black walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. European oak European oak European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. Dark brown house leather Dark brown house leather Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. Oiled wood Oiled wood An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. • Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. • To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains: • As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: • Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) • Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. Lacquered wood Lacquered wood A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: • Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. • Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. House leather House leather Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.
