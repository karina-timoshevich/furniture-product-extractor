It was Walter Cox himself who started the business as a watch maker in 1918 after he'd served in the First World War, the shop was originally based in Church Street then moved to the current site on Welbeck Road in 1935. Douglas Cox took over from him followed by David Cox, Walter's sons.  David and his wife, Kathleen, retired 16 years ago and now Samantha, their daughter, and her husband John, run the shop.  Over the years the shop has sold many different products including paint, prams, clothes and shoes. Long before Netflix and Firesticks, you could forget about Blockbusters, Walter Cox was the place to go for all your rental videos. Through the years the shop has changed what it sells to keep up with current trends and fashions, one thing that has not changed is the pride we take in our customer service to all our existing and new customers. Today the shop sells a wide range of household furniture, beds, carpets and household electricals from leading brands such as Hotpoint, Indesit, Whirlpool, Lifestyle Floors, Dura Beds and Julian Bowen.
