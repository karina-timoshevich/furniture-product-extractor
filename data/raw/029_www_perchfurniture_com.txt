We offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as "in good condition" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released. The customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited. Additional shipping and delivery charges will apply to orders that use store credit.
